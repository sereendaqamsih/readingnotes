- A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
- What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say some of the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.
- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
