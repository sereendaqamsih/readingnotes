- You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might to be.the result will be boolean true or false.( == equal to, != not equal to,===strict equal to, !=== strict not equal to, >grater than, < less than,>= greater than or equal to,<=less than  or equal to ).


- Logical operators allow you to compare the result of more than one compartion operator(&& logical and, || logical or,! logical not)


- Loops check a condition. if it returns true, acode block while run. then condition will be checked again and if still returns true,the code block while run again. it repeats until the condition returns false.(for:if you need to run code specific number of times  ,while: if you don't now how many times the code should run,do while: it will always run the statments inside the curly braces at least once even if the condition evaluate to false)
