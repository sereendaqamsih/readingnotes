*  A JavaScript file is just a text file (like HTML and CSS files are) but it has a . j s file extension, so save this file with the name add-content . j s

* be orgnized by keep the files organize, your JavaScript files can live in a folder called scripts,javascript,or js. 

* When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. 

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser,the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created. 

* Java language:
  - A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.Statements should end with a semicolon.
  - JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means something different to HourNow or HOURNOW.
  - You should write comments to explain what your code does.They help make your code easier to read and understand.This can help you and others who read your code
    -MULTI-LINE COMM ENTS To write a comment that stretches over more than one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with the /* characters and ending with the */ characters. Anything between these characters is not processed by the JavaScript interpreter.
    -SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS In a single-line comment, anything that follows the two forward slash characters I/ on that line will not be processed by the JavaScript interpreter. Singleline comments are often used for short descriptions of what the code is doing.

- A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs.
