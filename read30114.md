Because healing requires your attention.
It requires you to be mindful about your body’s needs, the food that nourishes your body, and the way that you take care of yourself.
Even your thoughts and emotions have an affect on your heart and organs.
You might be eating the best quality food on Earth, but if you don’t care about other aspects of your life, you won’t feel balanced.
