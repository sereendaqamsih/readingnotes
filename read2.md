- HTML has six "levels" of headings.
- By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.
- By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.
- The <sup element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.
- The <sub element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas.
- <br / As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag <br />.
- To create a break between themes such as a change oftopic in a book or a new scene in a play you can add ahorizontal rule between sections using the "<hr / "tag.
- The use of the <strong element indicates that its
content has strong importance.
- The <em element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.
- The <blockquote element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Note how the <p element is still used inside the <blockquote element.
- The <q  element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the <q element, however Internet Explorer does not therefore many people avoid using the <q element.
- If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the <abbr element can be used. A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.
- When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book,film or research paper, the <cite element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.
-The first time you explain some new terminology  perhaps an academic concept  in a document, it is
known as the defining instance of it.
- The <address element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.
-The <ins element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the <del element can show text that has been deleted from it.

# CSS:
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.

 # JavaScript:
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.Statements should end with a semicolon.
- You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand.This can help you and others who read your code. (single line comment/ , multi line comment /* and end by */).
- USING A VARIABLE TO STORE A STRING or number or boolean.
- there is some roles to name variable(start with $ or letter or underscore but not a nomber,name can contain $ number underscore but not contain dash or dot,cannot use keywords or reserved words, dont give same,name of varible indicate to data type,use camel case).
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
-There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ...while. Each repeats a set of statements.
