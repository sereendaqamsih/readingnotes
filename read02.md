## Git intro

#### Version Control: is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

#### Git: is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

#### Stashing Changes:When you are not ready to commit changes but do not want to lose them either, git stash is a great option. This command temporarily removes changes and hides them, giving you a clean working directory. When you are ready to continue working on the changes, simply use the git stash apply command to retrieve the hidden changes.
