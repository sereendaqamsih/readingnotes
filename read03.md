## [design]
##### Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important tounderstand who your target audience is.

##### The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped.To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called card sorting. This involves placing each piece of information that a visitor might need to know on a separate piece of paper and then organizing the related information into groups.

#####  A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
##### The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

##### When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.

##### Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.Good navigation tends to follow these principles concise,clear, selective,Interactive.

## HTML Layout

##### HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

##### The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not. When the <aside> element is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the article it relates to.

##### HTML5 allows web page authors to place an <a> element around a block level element that contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block into a link. This is not a new element in HTML5, but it was not seen as a correct usage of the <a> element in earlier versions of HTML.

## HTML markup

##### If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters: <!-- comment goes here -->

##### The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box
