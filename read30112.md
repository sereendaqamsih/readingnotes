# nosql vs sql

- Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

 SQL|NoSQL
------------ | -------------
Relational Databases |non-relational or distributed database. 	 
are table based databases| NoSQL databases are document based
have predefined schema|dynamic schema for unstructured data
are vertically scalable|horizontally scalable
uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful|ueries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

 	 
- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. 

- Give a real world example.
MySQL Community Edition MySQL database is very popular open-source database. It is generally been stacked with apache and PHP, although it can be also stacked with nginx and server side javascripting using Node js


- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.

- Give a real world example.
MongoDB

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. 

- Which type of database is best for scalability?
 SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.

# sql vs nosql 

- What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language

- What is a realational database?
It’s a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.


- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
Logical Data Structure.

- What is a ‘schema’?
The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed


- What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL is a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first - an alternative to the more rigid relational databases.


- Howo does it work?
Each type of NoSQL database would be designed with a specific customer situation in mind, and there would be technical reasons for how each kind of database would be organized. The simplest type to describe is the document database, in which it would be natural to combine both the basic information and the customer information in one JSON document. In this case, each of the SQL column attributes would be fields and the details of a customer’s record would be the data values associated with each field.


- What is inside of a Mongo database?
MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents


- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
While MongoDB is more flexible because it’s ensures high and diverse data availability.

- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
