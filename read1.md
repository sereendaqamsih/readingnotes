## HTML:
###### All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.
- HTMl main content:
 < html >
< head >
< title >This is the Title of the Page< /title >
< /head >
< body >
< h1 >This is the Body of the Page< /h1 >
< p>Anything within the body of a web page is
displayed in the main browser window.< /p>
< /body>
< /html>

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.

* You can add comments to your code between the
< !-- and --  > markers.

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

* The < div> and < span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.

* < iframes > cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.

* The < meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.

* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

### CSS :

* take ideas about your ausiance and why they will visit your website.

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.

* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present

### Javascript:

* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

* The HTML < script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the < link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
