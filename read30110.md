# Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
- What is a ‘call’?
At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).


- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
One call at a time.


- What does LIFO mean?
Last in, first out (LIFO).

- Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
function firstFunction(){
  console.log("Hello from firstFunction");
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
  console.log("The end from secondFunction");
}

secondFunction();

- What causes a Stack Overflow?
The most-common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.

# JavaScript error messages

- What is a ‘refrence error’?
This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

- What is a ‘syntax error’?
this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

- What is a ‘range error’?
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

- What is a ‘type error’?
this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
- What is a breakpoint?
The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

- What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
by putting a debugger statement in the code to identify JavaScript errors
